# ‍Hello There!👋

Hey, I'm Kishore – a Backend Engineer who's into algorithms, physics, and SaaS. I build with Next.js, Go, and AWS in addition to C++ for low-level stuffs. **I genuinely believe that the stupidest ideas are the ones that can actually flip the world upside down**, and I love code them to life. Feel free to ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-raja-baab55261/)
